# Java-Coding-Problems


## Overview

Java is a versatile and widely-used programming language known for its platform independence, strong community support, and extensive libraries. It was first developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle Corporation) in the mid-1990s and has since become one of the most popular programming languages in the world.

## Key Features

- **Platform Independence**: Java programs can run on any platform with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), making it highly portable.

- **Object-Oriented**: Java is an object-oriented language, emphasizing modular and reusable code.

- **Rich Standard Library**: Java comes with a comprehensive standard library, including classes for data structures, networking, I/O, and more.

- **Memory Management**: Java handles memory management automatically through its garbage collection system, reducing the risk of memory leaks.

- **Security**: Java includes built-in security features, such as sandboxing and access control, making it suitable for developing secure applications.

- **Community and Ecosystem**: Java has a large and active community, with extensive resources, frameworks, and libraries available for various applications.

## Getting Started

To start coding in Java, you'll need to set up the Java Development Kit (JDK) and an integrated development environment (IDE) such as Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or Visual Studio Code. You can find detailed installation instructions in the [official Java documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/).

## Example

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```
